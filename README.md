Veritas.jl is a work in progress, and is currently unusable. Any contributions are appreciated.

As Julia is a dynamic language that has not been formally validated, Veritas.jl should not be relied upon as a fully verified tool. It is intended as a research and educational prototype and should not be used in high-risk or safety-critical applications.
